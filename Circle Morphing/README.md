# Circle Morphing #

Examples of morphing a circle into a primitive, and back again.

* Example 1: Morphing a circle into a triangle by means of lerping ([here](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/P5js/blob/master/Circle%20Morphing/Circle%20Morph%20Lerp/sketch.js)).
* Example 2: Morphing a circle into a triangle by means of vertex removal, until only the three triangle points remain ([here](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/P5js/blob/master/Circle%20Morphing/Circle%20Morph%20Vertex%20Removal/sketch.js)).
* Example 3: Morphing a circle into a square by means of superellipse parametric equations ([here](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/P5js/blob/master/Circle%20Morphing/Circle%20Morph%20SuperEllipse/sketch.js)).
