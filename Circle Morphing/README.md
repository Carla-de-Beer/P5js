# Circle Morphing #

Examples of morphing a circle into a primitive, and back again.

* [Example 1:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/P5js/blob/master/Circle%20Morphing/Circle%20Morph%20Lerp/sketch.js) Morphing a circle into a triangle by means of lerping.
* [Example 2:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/P5js/blob/master/Circle%20Morphing/Circle%20Morph%20Vertex%20Removal/sketch.js) Morphing a circle into a triangle by means of vertex removal, until only the three triangle points remain.
* [Example 3:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/P5js/blob/master/Circle%20Morphing/Circle%20Morph%20SuperEllipse/sketch.js) Morphing a circle into a square by means of superellipse parametric equations.
* [Example 4:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/P5js/blob/master/Circle%20Morphing/Circle%20Morph%20Steer/sketch.js) Morphing a circle into a square by means of a steer and arrival algorithm.
